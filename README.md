Linked lists are the ancestors to arrays and array lists. The reason we no longer use them that often, is because of the amount of overhead space a linked list uses. A linked list is a list of something called nodes. A node is an element along with a reference. An array is like a park bench. They are only so big and can only fit a set amount of people. A linked list is like a group of people holding hands. When following along with the video one of the challenges I faced was how many different parts of the code I had to create. It was a bit much to follow along, but I was able to overcome it by making sure everything was included. The iterations were also a bit strange, because it used the Next method. Next is what linked lists use to iterate through the list. In the future, I will be comparing linked lists to disjoint sets and the pros and cons between the two. If I ever need to use a linked list in a serious project, I would likely use it when I need a flexible data structure. Something that I could add and delete elements from easily.
